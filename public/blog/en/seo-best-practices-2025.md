Google's Core Web Vitals remain a significant ranking factor. Focus on:

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Aim for under 2.5 seconds

- Use structured data to help search engines understand your content
- Optimize for conversational queries and voice search

## 3. Mobile-First Indexing

Mobile optimization is non-negotiable:

- Ensure responsive design across all devices
